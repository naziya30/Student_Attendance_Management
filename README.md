# Student_Attendance_Management
created student attendance management program using c program.
This Attendance Management System is a simple C program that helps track student attendance. Users can add students, take attendance (mark present/absent), check attendance records, and remove students using a menu-driven interface. The program stores student names and their attendance counts in arrays, allowing easy management. It is a console-based system, making it lightweight and easy to use. Future improvements could include file storage for record keeping and a GUI interface.
